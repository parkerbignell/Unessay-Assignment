## Process Letter (Dec. 8th)
My goal upon completing this assignment is to have constructed an exact copy of the lexumbourg American Cemetery in Minecraft. I am aware of the various difficulties that will entail, but I am attempting to render it in the most attractive and informative way possible. From the first few days of developing, I have tried my best to create an exanmple of the United States flag, which comes across as much more rough than one would think when made out of concrete blocks in Minecraft. As one can see from that rough sketch I made on the sheet of paper, I am trying to develop the my design to resemble exactly that of the real-life image of the cemetery, complete with General George S. Patton's grave, as well as Medal of Honor Recipents Day G. Turner and William D. McGee. So far I have placed multiple graves in the shape of crucifixes to resemble those seen at the cemetery. I plan on doing three columns of them of at least five rows each by the time the assignment is completed and hopefully I have enough space to do so. This must be how it must have felt when the cemetery was first constructed in 1944, under General Patton's supervision. I have also included a significant amount of foliage, such as flowers, grass and trees, in order to better emulate the appearance of the cemetery. I hope to put flowers in all appropriate areas that corresspond with the rough sketch I made, as well as for the area surronding the cemetery, as Luxembourg is city surronded by forestry. I also hope the trees I plant that are spruce and oak are able to develop quickly enough in order to reach this goal by December 22nd.
## Process Letter (Dec. 9th)
Since documenting my last process letter, I have added in the gravesite of General George S. Patton, as well as the foliage in the surrounding area. I built a higher level for where I will add strcutures in future stages of my development, as well as plants and a gate to closely resemble the details present at the actual cemetery. I surrounded the grave with moss and small plants, the exact inscription on the General's grave, a chain protecting it from vandalism, as well as a specific stone pattern in front of the gravesite. The area I ran into the most difficulty would have to be the idea of the flags, as I tried to craft my own banners for the United States and Luxembourg flags, but those did not work, so I instead tried to make them on a loom, all the while trying to learn the techniques online. That did not work either, so I eventually changed the dimensions of the moss-covered background to just put up banners depicting the main colours of each country's flag, albeit upside down. As a result, I successfully completed my model of one of the most crucial sections of the cemetery. 
## Process Letter (Dec. 10th)
Today, I added various other parts to my design.
